The Product Card is the component that contains the main elements of a product, such as the image, price, quantity input, and add to cart button. <br /> 
It is used to dictate which Shopify product is linked to the current div/section. <br /> <br /> 
This component is used by Looop to find the add-to-cart  button, quantity input, options selector, and subscription selector related to the product.

</Frame>

Attributes:
```html
looop=productcard
```
```html
looopid=LOOOP_ID_FIELD_OF_PRODUCT_CMS
```

```html
lp-default-variant=LOOOP_ID_OF_DEFAULT_VARIANT
```

The value of `looopid` is the Shopify ID of the product. This can be assessed using the dynamic value for the custom attribute in element setting in Webflow designer. 

<Note>
On **product page** we will use the section as product card, and will place all ecommerce related elements inside the product card.<br />
For **collection lists** we will use the Webflow Collection Item as the product card, and will place all ecommerce related elements inside the product card.
</Note>

<Warning>
Without the `looopid` attribute, the product card will not be linked to a product and will not be able to add the product to cart of fetch options and subscription plans for the product.
</Warning>
