The Product Card is the component that contains the main elements of a product, such as the image, price, quantity input, and add to cart button. <br /> 
It is used to dictate which Shopify product is linked to the current div/section. <br /> <br /> 
This component is used by Looop to find the add-to-cart  button, quantity input, options selector, and subscription selector related to the product

</Frame>

Attributes:
```html
looop=productcard
```
```html
looopid=SHOPIFY_ID_OF_PRODUCT_FROM_PRODUCTS-CMS_FIELD[LOOOP-ID]
```
The value of `looopid` is the Shopify ID of the product. This can be assessed using the dynamic value for the custom attribute in element setting in Webflow designer. 

<Warning>
Without the `looopid` attribute, the product card will not be linked to a product and will not be able to add the product to cart of fetch options and subscription plans for the product.
