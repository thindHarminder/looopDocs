Product options element shows set of options avilable for parent product card. When user selects the options, Looop updates the price, compare-price and hero picture.
 You can design product options using a [dropdown](/webflow/productcard/dropdown-options) or [radio](/webflow/productcard/radio-options) button.

## Setup
Item quantity input consists of three elements: quantity input, a quantity minus button, and a quantity plus button. This input helps users choose the items to add to their cart.
You have the freedom to design this field as your heart desires. Just make sure that the Quantity input is a quantity minus button and a quantity plus button is in the same parent element.
