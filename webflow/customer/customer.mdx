## Required Page Structure

We need all the following pages in the webflow project in a `account` folder:
1. [Login](/webflow/customer/login) - Used to login to the account
2. [Signup](/webflow/customer/signup) - Used to create a new account
3. [Recover](/webflow/customer/recover) - Used to recover a lost password
4. [Reset](/webflow/customer/reset) - Used to set a new password after a recovery
