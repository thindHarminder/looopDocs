## Required Page Structure

We need all the following pages in the webflow project in a `account` folder:
1. Login - Used to login to the account
2. Signup - Used to create a new account
3. Recover - Used to recover a lost password
4. Reset - Used to set a new password after a recovery

<Frame>

</Frame>

You can also create a profile and order page using following Looop Elements:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Customer Variables"
    icon="dollar-sign"
    href="/webflow/cart/default/discount-form"
  >
   A text element that shows the currency symbol of the selected market.
  </Card>
   <Card
    title="Customer Update Form"
    icon="dollar-sign"
    href="/webflow/cart/default/discount-form"
  >
   A text element that shows the currency symbol of the selected market.
  </Card>
  <Card
