## Root Variables
1. looop_on-login - This variable is true when the customer is logged in.
2. looop_on-logout - This variable is true when the customer is logged out.

## Combination of variables
Each of the root variables can be combined with sub-variables to create a logic to show customer profile values like name, email, phone etc. or modify elements visibility.

## How to use

We use the customer variables by setting custom attributes on the Webflow elements, where the root variable is the name of the attribute and the value is the sub-variable.

For example, to show an element when the customer is logged in, we can set the custom attribute:
    
    ```html
    looop_on-login=show
    ```
