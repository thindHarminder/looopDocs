The cart element has two states - empty and default. You can style the cart in the empty state and the default state separately. The cart is empty by default.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/cart-wrapper.jpg" />
</Frame>

## Cart wrapper
This is the outermost wrapper of the cart. It contains the cart states.

Give this cart wrapper an attribute of 
```html
looop=cart
```
## Developing cart states

Inside this wrapper, we need to add two required elements - the empty cart and the default cart.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Empty State"
    icon="box-open"
    href="/webflow/cart/empty"
  >
    This cart state is visible when the cart is empty.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Default State"
    icon="boxes-stacked"
    href="/webflow/cart/default"
  >
    This cart state is visible when the cart has items.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
