title: 'Checkout Button'
description: 'The "checkout button," as it self explains, redirects the user to checkout.'
---


This button has two states: default state and loading state. These two states are achieved by creating a custom button with two required elements:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/checkoutbutton.webp" />
</Frame>

## Button Setup
Add the following custom attribute to your Webflow element:
```html
looop=checkout
```

## Text Block
This would be your button text and the default state of the button. This text block needs to have the following custom attribute:
```html
"looop"="checkoutText"
```

## Loader

This would be the loading state of your button (triggered when users click the checkout button). In the background, looop will communicate with Shopify to create a checkout with the user's current cart items and their quantity. 
This loader can be any Webflow element with the following custom attribute:
```html
"looop"="checkoutLoader"
```

<Note>
We recommend that you don't use Webflow's native button or div block to create this button. We recommend using Webflow Custom element to create this button.
