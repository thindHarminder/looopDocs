## How to use
<Frame>

When you go to the Webflow Setup tab in the Looop dashboard, you will see the CMS Verifier section.
If any CMS field is missing you will see a red error icon or a yellow warning icon.

### Field errors
<Frame>

To further investigate the CMS structure click on any CMS collection name to to see the fields that are missing or incorrect.

- If you see a danger or warning icon on the top right next to the CMS collection name, it means that Looop was unable to find this CMS collection in your Webflow project.

- If you see a danger icon next to any CMS field, it means that Looop was unable to find this CMS field with the same `name` in your CMS collection.

- If you see a warning icon next to any CMS field, it means that Looop was unable to find this CMS field with the same `field type` in your CMS collection.

#### Verify reference and multi-reference fields

Looop CMS verifier shows you the field name, field type, and references it is looking for in comparison to the field name and field type it found in your CMS collection.

<Frame>

</Frame>

The schema is - `Field Name` `Field Type` `Reference CMS` 

- In the fields found section you will be able to see the fields that Looop found in your CMS collection, their type, and reference. Here you can see if the reference text is missing in the found fields. This means that the referenced CMS found is incorrect.
