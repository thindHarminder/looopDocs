## Setup your Looop store
<Note>
Looop store simply means a connection between a Webflow site and a Shopify store. Your account can have multiple stores, each Looop store will have a connection to one unique Webflow site and Shopify store.
</Note>
You need to have a Looop account to start building your store. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://manage.looop.com). 

By default when you sign up, you will have a store created for you and you will be redirected to set up the integration with Webflow and Shopify.
